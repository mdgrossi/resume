# Professional R&#232;sum&#232; of Matt Grossi
### Oceanographer | Data Scientist

This repository contains my professional private sector r&#232;sum&#232; and academic curriculum vit&aelig; rendered in `pdf`, `html`, and `docx`[^1] formats.

The `pdf` version is a custom Quarto implementation of the LaTeX [moderncv](https://ctan.org/pkg/moderncv) template. The implementation is derived from the [modern2-cv](https://github.com/schochastics/modern2-cv) template by [schochastics](https://github.com/schochastics). It is by no means a full implementation of this template. It only implements the features and customizations I needed for my particular use case.

The `html` rendering supports integeration with my [portfolio website](https://mdgrossi.github.io). It is heavily inspired by and based upon this [quarto-resume](https://github.com/busemorose/resume_quarto) by user [busemorose](https://github.com/busemorose).

Credit and kudos to both authors, as well as all upstream template authors, none of whom I know personally. Thank you for your contributions to [open science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_science). To pay it forward, I have [templated my implementation](https://mdgrossi.github.io/resume-quarto-moderncv/) as well.

The `docx` version lacks automatic formatting. It exists primarily as a means of quickly and easily populating an MS Word document with the same content in the event such a format is required. It should be downloaded and manually formatted prior to use.

If you wish to replicate this implementation, with or without your own formatting modifications, please fork or clone [the template repo](https://github.com/mdgrossi/resume-quarto-moderncv) instead of this one.
